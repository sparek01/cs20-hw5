Answers to questions
1. Discuss a case study for using a technology such as XML or JSON.
    XML or JSON are useful laguages when dealing with the creation of databases.
    They are used for transferring data between a server and a web application.

2. Which do you prefer: XML or JSON? And why?
    I prefer XML because the syntax feels more intuitive because it is quite
    similar to HTML. However I also like JSON because it is much cleaner to look
    at.

3. What was the most interesting part of this assignment?
    I liked writing the JSON file because it was a new experience for me. It was
    interesting to see it all come together when the file is linked within the
    HTML.
